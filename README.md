## The Aim
The aim is simple, Make the world a better place for Animals (and Humans).

## The Problem
The problem we aim to solve is the difficulty of finding and rehoming (such as fostering or adobpting) animals. Many people would like to resue an animal but have pacticular requirements such as they live young humans or other animals which makes finding a match more difficult. 
There are large charities that have a large selection of animals but there are lots more smaller charities that also have animals that could match someones requirements but finding them is tiresum and error prone. So instead of rehoming, people find it easier and quicker to buy a new puppy/kitten instead.

## The solution
We want to provide a single user interface for the full process. Charties, shelters, resuces, and so on, are able to list their animals and people are able to search for these animals that match their pacticular requirement. The aim is to a have seamless process everyone.

## The Outcome
If we are successful, more animals will get rehomed thus leading to a better life for everyone involved.

## The Technology
There is nothing cutting edge required to provide an end-to-end solution. We can build on the giants of others to reach our aim with relatively little backing.

### Opensource
This project is opensource so that others that want to progress us to our goals are able to do so. Their contributions will help make the world a better place for Animals (and Humans), and this even includes themself as they'll be able to demostrate their skillsets when looking for jobs.

## The Partners
We're not going to do this on our own. We need to partner with as many existing charities to get their animals listed on our website. The more animals we're able to list, the more users will want to use our site. To get animals on our site, we can use scrappers and APIs but we can also provide them web (and mobile) interface.

### Extra Partner Solutions
Just getting animals on "another" website is great, but we can do better than that. We can offer more to save the charties time, effort and money.

#### Applicant Screening
We can add systems and processes to automatically vet applicants. This can include the same checks that banks do (such as KYC - Know Your Customer) and also collect other vital information via forms, such as living conditions and videos of their home. This way partners have all the information upfront saving lots of time by not repeating questions. Applicants also have the same benifit, they can fill in the form once, and submit applications for multiple animals.

#### Exporting and Sharing
As we provide our own APIs we can export the same Animal data via RSS feeds and to other platforms, like Twitter and Facebook.
